3. Overflow : [visible] (default): Content overflows the container without any clipping. 
                It may extend beyond the container's boundaries.
            [hidden]: Content that exceeds the container's dimensions is 
                clipped and not displayed. It is effectively hidden from view.
            [scroll]: Adds both horizontal and vertical scrollbars to the container,
                allowing the user to scroll and view the overflowed content.
            [auto:] Similar to scroll, this value adds scrollbars only if necessary. 
                If the content fits within the container, no scrollbars are displayed. 
                If content overflows, scrollbars appear to enable scrolling.
